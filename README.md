# Web API: Code Quiz

Description: 
Timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

# Status:
In Progress 

# Criteria

Advanced Javascript principles were applied to meet functionality criteria below:

    1. Click the button to start timer and present a question
    2. Once answered another question is presented
    3. If question answered incorrectly the time is subtracted from the clock
    4. The quiz is over after all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    5. After the quiz is over the participant saves their initials and score
   

Additional items may be required as the project develops. At this time there are no planned changes but open to scale.
